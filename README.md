### 🧭 About Me

🎓 **Education**: Bachelor of Economics & Finance, Master of Sustainable Accounting and Finance @ HKU  
📌 **Research Interests**: Causal Inference, Machine Learning, Sustainable Finance  

🧐 A relentless experimenter who treats every dataset like a mystery novel — there’s always a twist you didn’t see coming  

🔍 Believer in the power of small steps — much like ants tracing complex paths on the beach, each “failure” is just a hidden solution  

🚀 Driven not by quick wins, but by building lasting knowledge that pushes boundaries and changes perspectives  

🧠 Forever curious, sometimes stubborn, always ready to learn — because research isn’t about perfection, but progress

> Like that ant on the beach, I embrace the twists and turns — each path an attempt to adapt, to learn, and to grow. I’m not afraid of setbacks, only of standing still. Let’s keep exploring 🌱
